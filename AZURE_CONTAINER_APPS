# Publishing to Azure Container Apps

Here's a detailed breakdown of publishing the UI using serverless hosting Microsoft Cloud. In order to proceed you would need an active Azure Subscription, e.g.:
- Profession/Premium MSDN package with $50/150 monthly credit
- Pay-as-you go
- Any other paid plan

We will create:
1. `Azure Container App` service to run `py_chat_ui` docker container and expose web UI
2. `Storage Account` with SMB file share to persist `py_chat_ui` files with user creds (hashed) and their dialogs

This set-up will cost **~$14 per month** (Jan 2024, East US 2).
